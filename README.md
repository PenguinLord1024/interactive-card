**Note**: Replace "path_to_screenshot.png" with the path to a screenshot of your card for a visual teaser.

## Features ✨

- **Three Sides**: The card has a front, middle (with two pages), and back.
- **Interactive Flipping**: Click on the card to see its different sides, replicating the experience of opening a real card.
- **Optional Music**: Add music to play when the card is clicked. If no music is added, there won't be any issues.

## Setup and Usage 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git

# Open the Card:
- Navigate to the project directory and open `backbone.html` in a browser.

# Customize:
- **Images**: Replace placeholders in the HTML (`path_to_front_image.jpg`, `path_to_middle_image_page1.jpg`, `path_to_middle_image_page2.jpg`, and `path_to_back_image.jpg`) with paths to your desired images.
- **Music**: To add music, replace the `path_to_music.mp3` in the HTML with your music file path. If you don't want to add music, simply remove the `source` element within the `audio` tag.
